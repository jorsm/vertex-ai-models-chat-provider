## ☁️ Google Cloud Prerequisites

> ⚠️ **Important:** Before using this extension, ensure your Google Cloud project is properly configured to avoid authentication or permission errors.
>
> 1. **Enable APIs**: Enable the **Agent Platform API** (`aiplatform.googleapis.com`) in the Cloud Console ([Docs](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform)).
> 2. **IAM Roles**: Your account requires the **Agent Platform User** (`roles/aiplatform.user`) role ([Docs](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/aiplatform)).
> 3. **Model Access**: For Anthropic Claude models, find them in the **Vertex AI Model Garden** and click **Enable** ([Docs](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/partner-models/claude)).

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install**: Find **Vertex AI Models Chat Provider** in the VS Code Marketplace and click Install.
2. **Authenticate**: Choose one of the following methods:
    - **Option A (Standard)**: Run `gcloud auth application-default login` in your terminal.
    - **Option B (Service Account)**: Run the command `Vertex AI: Paste Service Account JSON Key` in VS Code and paste your JSON key.
3. **Configure**: Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl+,`) and set your **GCP Project ID** in `vertexAiChat.projectId`.
4. **Chat**: Open the Chat panel (`Ctrl+Shift+I`) and select a **Vertex** model from the picker.

## 🛡️ Enterprise-Grade Authentication

This extension moves away from traditional API keys in favor of **Identity and Project-based authentication**. By using your native Google Cloud credentials or Service Accounts, you gain several professional advantages:

- **🔒 Secure by Design**: No sensitive API keys to paste, rotate, or leak. Credentials stay in your OS keychain (via `SecretStorage`) or the `gcloud` secure store.
- **🏢 Automatic Billing Switching**: Simply set a Project ID in your workspace settings. Billing follows your context as you switch between different client or internal projects.
- **📈 Centralized Governance**: Admins can manage model quotas and IAM permissions centrally. Opt-in request labeling provides granular visibility into cost distribution across your organization.
- **⚡ Dedicated Performance**: Leveraging your own GCP project ensures you aren't sharing rate limits with other users on a global API key.

### Supported Methods

Choose the workflow that fits your environment:

- **Standard ADC**: Uses your system's `gcloud` identity. Ideal for standard local development.
- **Encrypted Secrets**: Paste a Service Account JSON key directly into VS Code. It is stored securely in your OS keychain (via `SecretStorage`) and never touches your repository or `settings.json`.
- **Local File Paths**: Reference a JSON key file on your machine. The path is stored privately in your workspace state, preventing platform-specific conflicts in shared repos.
- **Environment Variables**: Automatically respects `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` if set.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🧠 Advanced Gemini Support**: Full support for **Gemini 3 Flash & Pro**, including "High Thinking" modes with thought block rendering and signature preservation.
- **⚡ Anthropic Performance**: Native support for **Claude Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku**, featuring automated **Prompt Caching (Ephemeral)** to reduce latency and costs for long conversations.
- **🔑 Smart Auth Recovery**: Intelligent detection of expired credentials or missing keys with one-click recovery and "Silent Fallback" logic to ensure zero-friction development.
- **🪄 AI Commit Messages**: Generate professional, conventional commit messages from staged Git changes with one click from the Source Control view.
- **🏷️ Cost Attribution Labels**: Opt-in to propagate user email and workspace names as GCP labels for granular cost tracking in the Google Cloud Console.
- **📊 Local Usage Dashboard and Real Time Costs Estimation**: An interactive, ECharts-powered dashboard to track your individual costs, token consumption, and payload metrics—all stored locally and updated in real time.

- **🔍 Smart Discovery**: Automatically probes regional endpoints (`global`, `us-east5`, `europe-west1`, `asia-southeast1`) to find and register only the models available in your specific GCP project.
- **👁️ Multimodal Vision**: Paste images directly into chat for analysis by vision-capable models like Claude 4.6 and Gemini 3.
- **🛠️ Tool Calling**: Support for streaming parallel tool execution, enabling models to interact with VS Code agents and external tools.
